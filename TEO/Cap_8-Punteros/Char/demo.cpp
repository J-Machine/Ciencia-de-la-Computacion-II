/*
A program
may contain character constants. A character constant is an integer value represented as a
character in single quotes. The value of a character constant is the integer value of the char-
acter in the machineâ€™s character set. For example, 'z' represents the integer value of z (122
in the ASCII character set; see Appendix B), and '\n' represents the integer value of new-
line (10 in the ASCII character set).

/*
Pointer-Based Strings
A pointer-based string is a built-in array of characters ending with a null character ( '\0' ),
which marks where the string terminates in memory. A string is accessed via a pointer to
its first character. The result of sizeof for a string literal is the length of the string includ-
ing the terminating null character.
