/*
The built-in array name can be treated as a pointer and used in pointer arithmetic. For
example, the expression
    *(b + 3)
also refers to the element b[3] . In general, all subscripted built-in array expressions can be
written with a pointer and an offset. In this case, pointer/offset notation was used with the
built-in arrayâ€™s name as a pointer.
